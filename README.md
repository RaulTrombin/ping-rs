### **Pro tip** :grey_exclamation:
For external use via UDP, consider using [bridges](https://github.com/patrickelectric/bridges) to share your serial device to the network. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/patrickelectric/bridges?tab=readme-ov-file#install-zap).

#### On the host :satellite: (Where ping device is connected):

```shell
bridges --port /dev/ttyUSB0:115200 -u 0.0.0.0:8080
```

#### On the client :computer::

```shell
cargo run --example ping_1d -- --udp-address 192.168.0.191 --udp-port 8080
```
